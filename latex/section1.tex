\part*{Project Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Project Introduction}

The goal of error control coding is to encode messages for transmission with redundancy such that the receiver can correct the errors in the transmission and recover the original data. In this project, encoders and decoders will be simulated and analysed by using MATLAB. The first section involves the design and simulation of the BCH code over BSC and AWGN channels. The second section uses LDPC codes to meet the requirements of a power limited system with very high reliability. Similar simulations are run and compared with the results of the BCH code.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Background}

Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem or BCH codes are a cyclic linear block code. They are a generalization of Hamming codes to \textit{t} errors. They are constructed over a finite Galois field which is generated with a primitive polynomial. This means that every element in the field must be expressable as a power of this polynomial. Since the BCH codes are multile error correcting codes and a generation pf the Hamming codes, there are possible codes for m>3, and t<2^(m-1).
and the minimum dstance d>=2t+1. The codes are formed by taking the remainder after dividing a polynomial representing our information bits by a generator polynomial. The generator is selected to give the code its characteristics. All codewords are multiples of the generator polynomial. v = c*G = c_0*g_0+c_1*g_1+c_2*g_2+⋯+c_(k-1)*g_(k-1), where G is the generator matrix. To generate a systematic BCH code, c(X) needs to be multiplied with x^(n-k), And then dividing x^(n-k) c(X) by g(X), we have x^(n-k) c(X)=a(X)g(X)+b(X), where b(X) is the remainder. So the code polynomial is given by v(X) = b(X) +x^(n-k) c(X).\\


\subsection{Implementation of BCH Decoder using Berlekamp's algorithm}

Berlekamp's algorithm allows one to correct errors that occur in a BCH code. If there are more errors than the code can correct, the algorithm will return a decoding failure. In BCH code, the BM algorithm finds an error locator polynomial by iterating through the syndrome polynomial; the upside is that the number of iterations linearly increases with the number of errors the code can correct. For a relatively small number of errors (3 for our code) the algorithm only needs to iterative 6 times before it stops.\\

\subsubsection{Design}

Berlekamp's algorithm produces an error locator polynomial which is tested to find the location of the roots.
In this project, the codeword length n=2^m-1 and the decoder operates over GF(2^m). In the very beginning, the function gf(r,m) is used to set GF field variables, and then all of the MATLAB operations we perform will automatically by performaed over GF(2^m). By using Berkelamp’s iterative algorithm, the syndromes are needed to be calculated first, s=(s_1,s_2,…,s_2t ). And then to find error location polynomial σ(X) by using Berlekamp’s iterative algorithm. After that, the error location numbers can be determined by finding the roots of σ(X). \\
 
\subsubsection{Implementation}

See below. ..hahaa \\
 
\subsection{Calculations and Results}

\subsubsection{Question 1} \textit{What is the generator polynomial for this code? Use MATLAB’s ’bchgenpoly’ function to verify your answer} \\
\\
The generator polynomial for a n = 31, k = 16, and t = 3 BCH code is $g(x) = x^{15} + x^{11} + 
x^{10} + x^{9} + x^{8} + x^{7} + x^{5} + x^{3} + x^{2} + x^{1} + 1$. 
This was verified with 
\begin{lstlisting}
[gen, t] = bchgenpoly(31,16)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Question 2} \textit{What is the minimum distance of this code?} \\
\\
For a BCH code, $d_{min} \geq 2*t + 1 = 7$, this was verified using 
\begin{lstlisting}
gfweight(double(gen.x), 31)
\end{lstlisting}
which gave a minimum distance calculation of 7.

\subsubsection{Question 3} \textit{Construct the reduced syndrome lookup table for this code. You need to write a program to do this since it is difficult to do it by hand. You do not need to include the whole array in your report due to its large size. Instead, just show the sub-array consisting of the first 5 rows in your report, and include a separate text file (*.txt) enumerating all the data in your electronic submission.} \\
\\
Generate the syndrome lookup table by:
\begin{lstlisting}
[h g k] = cyclgen(31, double(gen.x))
trt = syndtable(h)
\end{lstlisting}

The first 5 rows are:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
\begin{tabular}{| *{31}{c} |}

\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & \textbf{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}

The corresponding syndromes for these error patterns are:\\
\begin{tabular}{| *{15}{c} | c c |}
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & = & \textbf{0}  \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & = & \textbf{1}  \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & 0 & = & \textbf{2}  \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & \textbf{1} & = & \textbf{3}  \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \textbf{1} & 0 & 0 & = & \textbf{4}  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\
\\
The rest of the array is in "trt.csv".

\subsubsection{Question 4} \textit{Based on the standard array you obtained in task 3, find out the weight distribution of the coset leaders.}
\begin{lstlisting}
weights = sum(trt')
A0 = sum(weights == 0)
A1 = sum(weights == 1)
A2 = sum(weights == 2)
A3 = sum(weights == 3)
A4 = sum(weights == 4)
A5 = sum(weights == 5)
\end{lstlisting}
Gives the weight distribution of $A_0 = 1$, $A_1 = 31$, $A_2 = 465$, $A_3 = 4495$, $A_4 = 13020$ and $A_5 = 14756$ where $A_i$ is the number of weight $i$ errors.

\subsubsection{Question 5} \textit{Design and implement an encoder using the generator polynomial for this BCH code.} \\
\\
The encoder with the generator polynomial was implemented using the cyclic properties of the code. The message, $c(X)$, is shifted by $n-k$ and divided by the generator polynomial to get the parity check bits by $b(X) = remainder[\frac{X^{n-k}c(X)}{g(X)}]$. The parity check bits are combined with the message for a systematic code. The function below shows our implementation.

See the function \textit{polBCHencoder.m}.

\subsubsection{Question 6a} \textit{Use MATLAB defined functions (eg. the ”decode” function) to decode the BCH code.}\\
\\
This decoder is implemented using MATLAB’s function \textit{decode()}. The matrix \textit{trt} is the syndrome decoding table calculated above using the \textit{syndtable()} function.

See the function \textit{matlabBCHdecode.m}.

\subsubsection{Question 6b} \textit{Design and implement a decoder using the syndrome decoding table in Task 3 for the BCH code.}\\
\\
The syndrome can be obtained by multiplying received codeword with the transposed parity-check matrix H. The corresponded error pattern is found by performing a look up in the trt table calculated above. The corrected code is then the codeword plus the error pattern. Our implementation is shown below. See the function \textit{syndLookupDecode.m}.

\subsubsection{Question 6c} \textit{Design and implement a decoder using the Berlekamp’s iterative procedure.}\\
\\
The implementation of Berlekamp's iterative procedure below used different notation to the textbook specified in \textit{http://www.mathworks.com.au/help/comm/ug/error-detection-and-correction.html} allowing easier implementation of the procedure. See the function \textit{berlekamp\_decode.m}.

\subsection{Sound analysis}

\subsubsection{Question 7} \textit{Simulate the implemented BCH encoder and decoder (using ANY method in Part 6) using the attached wave file (austinpowers.wav) in a BSC channel for different transition probabilities. Discuss the impact of changing different transition probability values.}\\
\\
The channel was simulated using the function \textit{playAudioOverBSC.m}. Different transition probabilities were input into the function. With a transition probability of below 0.05 the sound could be heard with a little noise audible. As p increased above 0.15 the noise increased to the level where it could no longer be clearly heard. Above 0.2 it was difficult to hear anything at all other than noise.

The plots for different p-values are shown below as a qualitative indicator of noise levels.

\subsection{BER analysis}

\subsubsection{Question 8a and 8b} \textit{Simulation over BSC Simulate the BCH code in a BSC channel (you are allowed to use MATLAB defined functions) and plot the BER versus transition probability for coded and uncoded systems on the same graph. Plot BER versus $\frac{E_b}{N_0}$ for coded and uncoded systems on the same graph by assuming that the SNR ($ = \frac{E_b}{N_0}$ ) is related to the transition probability for the coded system via $X_{dB,coded} = 10 \log_{10}(\frac{[Q^{- 1} (p)]^2}{R}) $ and that for uncoded system is $X_{dB,uncoded} = 20\log_{10}(Q^{- 1} (p)) $, where $Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int\limits_{x}\limits^{+\infty} e^{ -\frac{z^2}{2}} dz $ and $0 < p < 0.5$.}\\
\textit{Simulation over AWGN channel with BPSK modulation $\{-1, 1\}$ Simulate the BCH code in an AWGN channel (you are allowed to use MATLAB defined functions) and plot the BER versus the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for a BPSK coded and uncoded systems on the same graph by using a hard-decision demodulator and binary decoder.}\\
\\
The implementation of the simulation is in \textit{bch\_ber\_simulation.m}.
This produced the following plots. \\

\subsection{Calculations and Results}

\textit{You are an engineer whose job is to design and analyze the performance of error control codes for different clients. Client 2 requires a code for satellite transmission of digital TV. The satellite is power limited and very high reliability is required (as close to Shannon capacity as possible). Low decoding complexity is desired, but is not essential.} 
\subsubsection{Question 1} \textit{Design the code (e.g. type of code, code parameters, and other relevant information) and justify its design}


%% ANSWER 
%% ======
To meet these requirements an LDPC code is used

For client 2, it is clear that an LDPC code will be necessary and these can provide performance that is close to the Shannon limit for an AWGN channel, compared to other modern codes. However, it is known that this is the case for very long block codes, which require computationally complex [TODOREF].
An existing solution for digital satellite television is present in the DVB-S2
standard, which uses LDPC as part of concatenated code with BCH coding\cite{morello2006dvb}. However,
the drawback of this scheme is the high decoding complexity, though this can be 
reduced somewhat by the special structure of the code [TODOREF]. Another factor to consider is the power limitation of the satellite, since a large LDPC block code will also entail high coding complexity, more hardware gates and thus more power. An alternative code choice
is the (1152, 2304) LDPC block code used in IEEE-802.16-2005, also known as WiMax [TODOREF]. This code is also irregular, which is known to exhibit superior performance over regular LDPC codes.

TODO: Expand on justification, summarize into table

\subsection{Sound analysis}

\subsubsection{Question 2} \textit{Simulate the chosen code using the attached wave file (austinpowers.wav) in a BSC channel for different transition probabilities (you are allowed to use MATLAB defined functions. Discuss the difference in sound quality compared to the BCH code in Section I, for different transition probabilities.}\\
\\

%% ANSWER 
%% ======

The code was simulated for the transition probabilities p = \{0.01, 0.05, 0.1\}. As a qualitative tool, plots of the waveform are included. Figures 1-3 provide a visual indicator of the noise. \\

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{plots/audio_over_bsc_ldpc_p_001.png}
\caption{LDPC Audio over BSC (p = 0.01)}

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{plots/audio_over_bsc_ldpc_p_010.png}
\caption{LDPC Audio over BSC (p = 0.1)}
\end{figure}

As the bit errors increase due to the transition probability, the noise becomes more prevalent. However, it is improved relative to BCH in the case of p = 0.05, showing LDPC has superior performance in this regard compared with BCH. However, there is not much difference in the case of p = 0.1, showing that the code has reached it's performance limitation for the particular channel, which is due to effective hard-decision decoding that is involved in a BSC channel. TODO: is it?
